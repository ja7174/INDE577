## The Single Neuron Linear Regression Model

### Dataset Used
Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The datasets are available for download and use [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data). 

### Libraries Used
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) <br>
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) <br>

### Task

Given one or more features of a Gentoo penguin,

1a. estimate it's body mass <br>
1b. choose which feature best estimates body mass <br>
1c. investigate ideal rate for alpha (the learning rate)<br>
1d. identify and observe limitations for the simplified model <br>
